# ml5 examples

This repository contains a variety of examples of a different kind built with p5.js and ml5.js.

Inspiration for most of them came from the work of [Daniel Shiffman](http://twitter.com/shiffman) and his channel on Youtube call [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw).
